**6.1** I slurped at my tea during
[elevenses](https://www.dictionary.com/e/word-of-the-day/elevenses-2019-01-03/)
in the bleak room. Someone had changed the R to an L one day; it gave us
cause to smile, until we realised there was one fewer mug.

"There will be no more biscuits!" we were told.

These
[neoteric](https://www.dictionary.com/e/word-of-the-day/neoteric-2019-01-02/)
times of austerity and healthy-eating meant one had to
[noodle](https://www.dictionary.com/e/word-of-the-day/noodle-2019-01-04/)
their own solution. I brought my own biscuits from home. I dunked one in
my tea, perhaps to
[auspicate](https://www.dictionary.com/e/word-of-the-day/auspicate-2019-01-01/)
in my mind's eye for a better tomorrow. Maybe I'd get fired. Maybe the
government would collapse. Maybe I'd get chocolate digestives, next
time. At least they gave us milk; a
[douceur](https://www.dictionary.com/e/word-of-the-day/douceur-2019-01-05/)
of a concession to keep us compliant. It was a
[palladium](https://www.dictionary.com/e/word-of-the-day/palladium-2019-01-06/)
to them, of course, what with the rumours of unrest percolating from the
quarters that didn't even get hot water.

**13.1** The topic of idle conversation inevitably depreciated to
*Mismatch Island*, the latest hit reality show to expose the
[labyrinthine](https://www.dictionary.com/e/word-of-the-day/labyrinthine-2019-01-08/)
spectrum of human misery. Like an
[iceblink](https://www.dictionary.com/e/word-of-the-day/iceblink-2019-01-12/)
signalling unsafe passage to a ship's captain, it had become an allegory
on society for the ruling classes; a tie-breaker to their question,
"Should we just
[terraform](https://www.dictionary.com/e/word-of-the-day/terraform-2019-01-11/)
Mars and leave them to it?"

"Did anyone see Misfit Island, last night?" asked Danny, with a
[pawky](https://www.dictionary.com/e/word-of-the-day/pawky-2019-01-09/)
grin.

Nobody liked Danny, but he wasn't wrong. In this latest episode, having
[caromed](https://www.dictionary.com/e/word-of-the-day/carom-2019-01-13/)
from an earlier defeat in the pickled egg eating contest, Jez, the
leader of the opposition, ultimately lost the people's vote. Each
departure cues the
[impresario](https://www.dictionary.com/e/word-of-the-day/impresario-2019-01-10/)'s
welcome to the next islander: an ex-suicide bomber who, for legal
reasons, we'll call *Jack from Essex* (they're all called *Jack from
Essex*).
[Salvific](https://www.dictionary.com/e/word-of-the-day/salvific-2019-01-07/),
he joined bouncy castle attendant Sandra, from Bradford. Hashtag
explosive!

**20.1** "Oi oi!" came the
[phatic](https://www.dictionary.com/e/word-of-the-day/phatic-2019-01-14/)
pronouncement, as *Jack from Essex* strode onto set.

This, of late, had become a trigger for me. I swear to God, if I hear it
on the street, I can only
[ratiocinate](https://www.dictionary.com/e/word-of-the-day/ratiocinate-2019-01-15/)
that I'll punch its speaker squarely in the face before breaking down
into uncontrollable tears. I digress. After the
[perfunctory](https://www.dictionary.com/e/word-of-the-day/perfunctory-2019-01-18/)
introductions were done with, this pair of
[gadabouts](https://www.dictionary.com/e/word-of-the-day/gadabout-2019-01-17/)
upped the ante of conversation to the dizzying heights of what could be
generously described as their careers.

"So what do you, like, do?" asked *Jack from Essex*.

"I own my own business," came Sandra's
[altiloquent](https://www.dictionary.com/e/word-of-the-day/altiloquent-2019-01-20/)
response.

"Oh wow, that's sick, babe! Doing what?"

"Events and entertainment management, mostly." Sandra's delusion was
palpable. "I've had some really high-end clients: celebrities,
[freegans](https://www.dictionary.com/e/word-of-the-day/freegan-2019-01-19/),
Illuminati, you name it!"

"Nice! So you must make a mint?"

Sandra quickly changed the subject, "So what about you?"

"Well, I'm kind of between jobs, at the minute. I quit my last one."

"Why's that?"

"I didn't like the commute."

As was the nature of the show, it would just be a matter of time before
our hapless heroes were meshed together, legs -- and everything
in-between --
[akimbo](https://www.dictionary.com/e/word-of-the-day/akimbo-2019-01-16/),
for all to gawk at. It wouldn't last, of course, but who needs love when
you've got ratings?

"I'll tell you what, though: Sandra is proper fit!", Danny interrupted
my soliloquy. Did I mention he's a prick?

**27.1** "Please proceed to Meeting Room B," echoed a dismembered voice
over the public address system; that same chilling voice with which they
overdub blacked-out sex offenders on the nightly news. My soggy excuse
for a biscuit dropped hopelessly into the gritty remains of my tea.

An all hands meeting could only mean one thing: some
[buzzwig](https://www.dictionary.com/e/word-of-the-day/buzzwig-2019-01-24/)
from upstairs was going to give us a pep talk; a futile attempt to
[adrenalise](https://www.dictionary.com/e/word-of-the-day/adrenalize-2019-01-23/)
the masses to their particular
[creed](https://www.dictionary.com/e/word-of-the-day/creed-2019-01-21/)
of corporate morality and, "Oh, by the way, we're going to milk you for
everything you've got."

Heidi, the presumed-illegitimate daughter to the
[oillionaire](https://www.dictionary.com/e/word-of-the-day/oillionaire-2019-01-27/)
family which owned the company,
[sashayed](https://www.dictionary.com/e/word-of-the-day/sashay-2019-01-26/)
in to the meeting room with that look of vague contempt, masked by her
fake smile and fake, well, fake everything, which comes so naturally to
our masters.

"Hello, people!" she beamed.

We weren't people to her, of course, just an inconvenience. Still, she
was a tiresome abstraction to us too, like free market capitalism or
Thursdays, so it was at least a balanced relationship. Her salutation
was met with an enthusiasm that only the sweet release of death could
surpass.

"Well, you all seem bright and cheerful!" I couldn't tell if she was
being sarcastic. "Let's warm up this meeting with a little exercise.
Whenever we speak, we must speak in
[lipogram](https://www.dictionary.com/e/word-of-the-day/lipogram-2019-01-25/)."

"What the Hell is that?" the new guy interrupted. The more experienced
amongst us looked sheepish and swallowed our tongues. He wouldn't be
here for much longer; we didn't even know his name. Poor bastard.

"A lipogram?" Heidi regained her posture. "Well, it's when you have to
avoid using a specific letter when you talk. It's fun! The idea is that
it forces you to be more deliberate about what you're trying to
communicate."

We all looked nervous. Was this a test? Heidi's gaze turned to me. I
didn't care any more; it was time for some civil disobedience.

"Let's start with you and," she paused to think, "the letter S."

I felt as though I was in a fucked up episode of *Sesame Street*.

"So, as I see it, something--" I was cut short.

"Remember!" Heidi had become visibly
[shirty](https://www.dictionary.com/e/word-of-the-day/shirty-2019-01-22/).
"No letter S."

"Sorry! Should we start afresh?" I paused, with the best pensive face I
could muster. "So, as I was saying, some--"

"Sshhh--" Heidi felt every eye in the room focused on her. "You know
what? Forget it!"

**3.2** Needless to say, any idiot could have
[prognosticated](https://www.dictionary.com/e/word-of-the-day/prognosticate-2019-02-02/)
the consequences of my little stunt. I had plausible deniability on my
side, but any perceived slight would have me answering to *The Man*;
that inalienable
[synecdoche](https://www.dictionary.com/e/word-of-the-day/synecdoche-2019-01-29/)
of the proletariat, whom count me proudly amongst their number. Sure
enough, I was summoned to an ominously-termed *consultation* with HR the
next morning.

My boss, Jamal, was invited to attend. I liked Jamal: he had
[bootstrapped](https://www.dictionary.com/e/word-of-the-day/bootstrap-2019-01-30/)
his way up to his lofty position from a relatively humble background. We
won't go into his origin story -- he isn't *Spiderman* -- but my
belaboured point is that he knows how to treat people respectfully.
While we waited for the directorate to grace us with their presence, he
engaged me in casual
[gibble-gabble](https://www.dictionary.com/e/word-of-the-day/gibble-gabble-2019-01-31/)
to put me at ease.

"So, if you could be any *Pokémon*, which would you choose?"

"I want to say *Slakoth*, but maybe now wouldn't be the best time to
mention that."

Jamal chuckled, "Nice one! I'd go for--"

Our ephemeral banter was interrupted by the arrival of HR, in all its
pomp and self-importance. It was almost pantomimic, as this orangutan of
a woman shifted her great heft into the meeting room, flanked by her
murine lieutenants, scurrying desperately about her in a
not-unprecedented attempt to avoid getting sat on.

"The book."

One of her minions deferentially heaved an enormous binder on to the
table in front of her. It seemed to billow with dust as what I could
only assume to be a thousand years of company policy, scrawled across a
[plexus](https://www.dictionary.com/e/word-of-the-day/plexus-2019-01-28/)
of loose leaves and paper-clipped notes, came thumping down. This was
HR's codex: document after document; countless amendments; revocations;
revocations to revocations. The works. I'm only surprised it wasn't
inscribed on to vellum scrolls, illuminated with the blood of peasants.
Of course, she knew it all, in excruciating detail, but it would be
against policy to not consult *the book*.

The
[hygge](https://www.dictionary.com/e/word-of-the-day/hygge-2019-02-03/)
invoked earlier by Jamal began to wear off; we were in their world now
and, while he had my back, there wasn't much he could do but nod
thoughtfully. I had made my bed and it was time to grin and bear it. My
mind -- when it wasn't mixing metaphors -- sought an out, but I didn't
know *the book* and only that contained the answers. The
[sirenic](https://www.dictionary.com/e/word-of-the-day/sirenic-2019-02-01/)
din of the fire alarm, maybe? That would only delay, even with genuine
fire. What event, what circumstance could bring this to an end?
